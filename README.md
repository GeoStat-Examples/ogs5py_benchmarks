## Purpose

To get in touch with [``ogs5py``][ogs5_link], most of the OGS5 benchmarks were rewritten into a ogs5py-script in this repository.
These benchmarks can be seen as a smorgasbord to provide a starting point for your own ogs5py model.

You can clone this repository with:

    git clone https://github.com/GeoStat-Framework/ogs5py_benchmarks.git

Or simply download it as a [zip-file][zip].

The original Benchmarks can be found here: https://github.com/ufz/ogs5-benchmarks


## Generation

The scripts were generated with the python script

        gen_benchmark_scripts.py

You can run all generated scripts for testing with the python script

        run_ogs5py_scripts.py
